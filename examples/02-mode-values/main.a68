# A mode is a like a type (REAL, INT, BOOL) #
# Here the constant 3.14 is called a denotation. #

REAL pi = 3.14;
INT a = 15;

# printf 13a means 13 ascii characters #
printf(($13a$, "Value of pi: "));

# g means the variable, l means newline. #
printf (($gl$, pi));

# g can print any mode #
printf (($gl$, a))
