# We define a complexe structure with STRUCT keyword #
# Here we have an object with property mark and point. Point is also a structure with members x and y. #

STRUCT(CHAR mark, STRUCT(REAL x, y) point) mypoint := ("O", (2, 3));

# Again another way to print #
print(("Here is the point:", new line));
print((mypoint, new line))
